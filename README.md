# LLM Training Repository

![Flowchart: Training an LLM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/llm-training/main/docs/llm-flowchart.png)

This repository contains a modular implementation for training Language Learning Models (LLMs) using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

## LLM Training Process

### 1. Define Objectives
- Define the purpose and goals of the LLM
- Determine target tasks (e.g., summarization, chat, code generation)
- Set performance metrics and benchmarks

### 2. Data Collection
- Gather diverse, high-quality training data
- Sources: public datasets (e.g., Wikitext), proprietary data
- Ensure data diversity across domains and languages
- Validate data quality and relevance

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and filter data (remove duplicates, noise)
- Tokenize text using appropriate tokenizer
- Format into training-ready datasets
- Implement data augmentation if needed

### 4. Model Design/Selection
- Choose model architecture (e.g., GPT-2)
- Define model size and complexity
- Evaluate computational requirements
- Set up training infrastructure

### 5. Training
- Configure hyperparameters
- Implement training loop with monitoring
- Use gradient accumulation for large models
- Track metrics and training progress

### 6. Fine-Tuning
- Adapt model to specific tasks/domains
- Use smaller, targeted datasets
- Optimize model performance
- Validate on test sets

### 7. Evaluation
- Calculate perplexity and other metrics
- Perform qualitative assessments
- Compare against baselines
- Gather human feedback if applicable

### 8. Deployment
- Package model for production
- Optimize for inference
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Deploy with appropriate scaling

### 9. Maintenance
- Monitor performance
- Collect feedback and new data
- Retrain or fine-tune as needed
- Implement continuous improvements
